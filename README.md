# Glima

**AI-powered insurance call center automation**

Glima automates insurance call center operations using voice AI — starting with FNOL (First Notice of Loss), claims status, billing, and policy renewals.

## Structure

- `research/` — Market research, competitive analysis, and industry reports
- `docs/` — Product documentation, architecture, and specs

## Vision

Insurance call centers handle millions of repetitive, structured calls every day. Glima replaces them with voice AI that's faster, cheaper, and always available — starting with the segments most ready for automation.
