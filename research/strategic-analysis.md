## 1. FNOL Automation Competitive Landscape

Five companies to watch in the FNOL automation space:

| Company | What They Do | Funding/Stage | Key Customers | Differentiator |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Tractable** | Computer vision AI for auto/property damage assessment at FNOL | $119M+, unicorn | Tokio Marine, Covéa, Admiral, The Hartford | Photo-based damage quantification at point of FNOL — assessment layer only, not full workflow |
| **Snapsheet** | End-to-end claims platform: FNOL intake → payment | $103–107M, late-stage | 16 of top 20 P&C carriers, 170+ total | Broadest platform coverage; deep carrier penetration; now layering AI agents on top |
| **Five Sigma** | AI-powered CMS with configurable FNOL workflows, triage, adjuster assignment | $46M total | Carriers, MGAs, TPAs, self-insured | Cloud-native CMS replacing legacy; strong MGA/TPA fit; highly configurable |
| **Gradient AI** | Predictive AI for claims severity, fraud detection, workers comp | $56M Series C (Jul 2024) | Carriers, large TPAs | Intelligence layer (predicts outcomes) not workflow automation — complementary play |
| **Pace** ⚠️ | Agentic AI replacing offshore BPO for submissions + claims processing | $10M Series A, Sequoia (Jan 2026) | Prudential, The Mutual Group, Newfront | Most direct Glima analog — explicitly targeting $70B insurance BPO market with agents |

**Key takeaways:**
- Tractable and Snapsheet are entrenched with large carriers — not realistic displacement targets early
- Five Sigma is the closest CMS competitor in the MGA/TPA space
- Gradient AI is analytics, not automation — complementary, not competitive
- **Pace is the one to watch** — same thesis as Glima, fresh Sequoia backing ($10M Series A, Jan 2026), but currently focused on submissions/underwriting over FNOL voice. Direct competitor on the roadmap.

## 2. Beachhead Recommendation: Tech-Forward MGAs in Specialty/E&S Lines

**Recommended ICP:** Specialty/E&S MGAs that have outsourced claims ops.

**Why MGAs win over carriers or TPAs:**

- **Market size:** MGAs write $50B+ in US premium, growing 10%+ annually — sufficient to build a real business without needing national carrier accounts
- **Accessibility:** Founder/operator-run. Procurement timeline: weeks, not years. Decision-maker is accessible, not buried in a procurement committee
- **Competitive white space:** Snapsheet and Five Sigma position as full CMS replacements (heavy, slow implementation). Tractable is auto-only. Pace is hitting submissions/underwriting first. FNOL workflow automation for MGAs is genuinely uncrowded
- **BPO displacement fit:** MGAs routinely outsource FNOL intake to BPOs — exactly what Glima replaces. They feel the pain acutely; one bad FNOL experience damages their carrier relationship
- **Land and expand path:** MGA win → carrier referrals → TPA introductions. Natural growth path upmarket

**Ideal customer profile:**
- Specialty/E&S MGA
- 20–200 employees
- $100M–$2B GWP
- Currently using a BPO or small internal team for FNOL
- Growing fast enough to feel operational squeeze

**Avoid for now:**
- National carriers (3+ year procurement cycles, 18-month pilots)
- TPAs (more commoditized, price-sensitive, lower strategic value as reference customer)

## 3. Investor Problem Statement (1-Page)

### The Problem

When a policyholder files a claim — after a car crash, a burst pipe, a business interruption — what happens next is shockingly manual. A human answers the phone. They key the same information into three systems. They email a PDF to an offshore adjuster. The adjuster reads the PDF and emails someone else. Three days later, the claimant still doesn't know what's happening.

This is First Notice of Loss. It is the opening moment of every claim, and it sets the tone for everything downstream: reserve accuracy, adjuster assignment, cycle time, fraud detection, customer satisfaction. Get FNOL wrong and you pay for it everywhere.

Yet in 2026, the majority of insurers — and the MGAs and TPAs that handle claims on their behalf — still process FNOL through manual call centers and offshore BPO providers. The average FNOL costs $30–50 to process via traditional BPO. Error rates are high. Cycle times are measured in days. Customer satisfaction in claims consistently ranks among the lowest of any industry touchpoint.

### Why Now

Three things have converged:
1. LLMs can now understand unstructured claims data — emails, PDFs, voice calls, web submissions — at human-level accuracy
2. Agentic AI can act autonomously across systems, not just extract information
3. The offshore BPO model is cracking: rising labor costs, quality inconsistency, and data sovereignty concerns are forcing insurers to look for alternatives

The $64B+ insurance BPO market is ready to flip.

### Why Glima

Glima is purpose-built to automate the full FNOL workflow: from first contact intake (phone, web, email, app) through coverage verification, triage, reserve setting, and adjuster assignment. We replace the outsourced workflow entirely — not a point solution, not a CMS requiring an 18-month implementation. Glima deploys in weeks alongside existing systems and replaces BPO headcount on day one.

### The Opportunity

Insurance operations BPO is a $64B global market. Claims ops are the largest single slice. Replacing BPO with AI-driven automation at 20% market penetration represents a $5B+ opportunity. The insurers who move first will have structurally lower operating costs — and the ones who don't will be subsidizing their competitors' growth.
