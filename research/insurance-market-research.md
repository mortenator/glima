# Glima Market Research: Automating Insurance Call Center Operations

*Prepared by Nator | February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

- **The US insurance BPO market is ~$64B globally in 2025 (CAGR 6.8%), with North America holding 35%+ share (~$22B+).** Claims processing alone accounts for 30%+ of BPO revenue, and outsourcing is already the dominant delivery model for FNOL, billing, and customer service at mid-size and small carriers.
- **Top segments for Glima:** Pet Insurance (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐), Specialty/Warranty (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐), and Personal Auto at the regional/MGA layer (⭐⭐⭐⭐) are the highest-opportunity targets — fragmented, cost-sensitive, high call volume, and structurally amenable to voice AI automation.
- **Key insight:** The market is at an inflection point. Labor costs have surged 20-30% post-COVID, offshore BPO quality is declining, and voice AI (ElevenLabs-class) is now production-ready for structured call types (FNOL intake, claims status, billing). Most incumbents are still human-based; the window to become the default AI-first insurance call center is open RIGHT NOW.
- **Recommended first move:** Target pet insurance carriers and vehicle warranty providers — small teams, high call volume, simple call scripts, zero legacy voice infrastructure, and strong willingness to try new vendors. Close 3-5 reference customers in 90 days, then move up-market to regional auto MGAs.

## 1. Market Overview

### Size of the US Insurance Call Center / BPO Market

Multiple analyst sources paint a clear picture of a large and growing market:

| Source | Market Size (2024-2025) | CAGR | Notes |
|--------|------------------------|------|-------|
| Mordor Intelligence | $64.31B globally (2025) | 6.79% → $89.33B by 2030 | Broadest definition |
| GM Insights | $7.2B (2024) | 5.4% | Narrower BPO definition |
| Market Research Future | $8.15B (2025) | ~6% → $14.35B by 2035 | Mid-range estimate |
| IMARC Group | ~$7.5B (2024) | 3.57% → $10.4B by 2033 | Conservative |
| Business Research Co. | → $10.79B by 2028 | 8.6% | Higher growth scenario |

**Best estimate for US insurance call center/BPO spend:** ~$8-12B annually in the US (North America ~35% of global = ~$22B of broader market). The segment Glima is targeting — structured voice call automation for carriers and MGAs — represents a subset of this, estimated at **$3-5B in addressable US spend**.

### How Much Is Outsourced vs. In-House

- **Majority of mid-size and small carriers outsource FNOL and claims-adjacent call center operations** to specialists. Large carriers (State Farm, Progressive, Allstate) run captive call centers.
- Industry surveys indicate **60-70% of carriers use some form of outsourcing** for at least one call center function.
- FNOL in particular is "more frequently outsourced to a specialist" than handled in-house (ACTEC).
- P&C lines captured **44.5% of the insurance BPO market** in 2024 due to high transaction volume and multi-party claims complexity (Mordor Intelligence).
- **Life and pension lead** overall BPO market share at 58.9% (IMARC) — but these are largely back-office processes, not call center.

### Trends Driving the Market

**1. Labor Cost Surge**
Post-COVID labor markets pushed US call center agent wages to **$18-25/hour for standard agents** and **$30-50/hour for licensed insurance agents** (Expivia). Outsourcing to traditional BPO saves 30-40% vs. in-house; AI automation can deliver **40-60% savings vs. traditional BPO** (Sonant.ai).

**2. AI Disruption — Now**
Voice AI has crossed the quality threshold. ElevenLabs' conversational agents (SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA compliant, 30+ languages) are being deployed in production customer service contexts. ElevenLabs launched its AIUC-1 ("AI Underwriter Certification") to enable enterprise insurance deployment at scale (Feb 2026). Floatbot's LISA/ADDI agents claim **80% automation of FNOL submissions**. Liberate handles **75% of digital FNOL with minimal carrier involvement**.

**3. Offshoring vs. Onshoring Tension**
There is a strong trend back toward US-based ("onshore") outsourcing, especially post-COVID quality complaints about offshore centers. Covenir has built an entire brand around "100% US-based onshore outsourcing." This creates an opening for AI — which is inherently onshore, 24/7, and accent-neutral.

**4. Carrier Consolidation Creating Small-Carrier Vulnerability**
The top 5 auto insurers captured 63.59% of the market in 2024 (S&P Global). Small and regional carriers are being squeezed on cost — making them prime buyers of cost-saving AI call center solutions.

**5. Why Now Is Compelling**
- Voice AI quality is now indistinguishable from human for structured interactions
- Insurance call scripts (FNOL, billing, status) are highly structured and AI-ready
- The BPO industry itself is disrupting — AI-native entrants like Glima can leapfrog legacy BPO infrastructure
- Small carriers can't afford $150M AI platforms (Glia) but desperately need the cost savings

## 2. Segment Analysis

### 2.1 Personal Auto Insurance

**Market Size**
- US direct premiums written: ~$300B+ (2024, State Farm, Progressive, Berkshire/GEICO, Allstate, USAA dominate with 63.59% market share)
- Estimated call center spend: **$2-4B/year** (industry estimates ~1-2% of premiums on call center operations)

**Call Center Usage**
- FNOL intake (every accident triggers a call)
- Claims status follow-up
- Billing disputes / payment processing
- Policy changes and renewals
- Glass/roadside claims intake

**Outsourcing Propensity: Medium-High**
Large carriers run in-house operations; regional carriers and MGAs (there are 2,000+ P&C carriers licensed in the US, of which ~500+ write meaningful auto) actively outsource FNOL and billing to specialists like ACTEC, Covenir, and Focus BPO.

**Market Fragmentation: Medium**
Top 5 control 63% of market. However, ~1,500 carriers write auto in some capacity — the long tail is very fragmented and cost-sensitive. Erie Insurance, GAINSCO, Kemper, The General, Bristol West are mid-size regional targets.

**AI Automation Potential: High**
FNOL calls are structured intake processes — accident date, location, vehicle info, description. Claims status is a lookup. Billing is a script. All three are excellent AI candidates with high containment rates.

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐**
Large market, but dominated by in-house shops at the top. Best opportunity at the regional carrier and MGA level.

---

### 2.2 Homeowners Insurance

**Market Size**
- US direct premiums written: ~$173.1B (2024, up 13.4% YoY)
- Estimated call center spend: **$1.5-3B/year**

**Call Center Usage**
- Storm/catastrophe FNOL surge calls (weather events drive massive call spikes)
- Claims status
- Coverage questions
- Billing
- Renewals

**Outsourcing Propensity: High**
Homeowners insurers face catastrophic call surges (hurricanes, wildfires) that make 24/7 in-house staffing economically irrational. Most mid-size carriers outsource surge capacity. Covenir's "Call Surge Guarantee" is specifically built for this.

**Market Fragmentation: High**
Hundreds of carriers, especially in coastal/high-risk states where national carriers have retreated. Florida, Texas, California have spawned dozens of small specialty homeowners carriers (Citizens, Heritage, Universal P&C, HCI Group, etc.).

**AI Automation Potential: High**
FNOL intake for home claims (storm damage, water damage) is structured. Weather-triggered surges are predictable. AI can handle initial intake and triage before routing complex claims to adjusters.

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐**
Strong outsourcing demand, catastrophe-driven urgency, but complex claims still need humans. Great for FNOL intake automation.

---

### 2.3 Pet Insurance

**Market Size**
- US direct premiums written: **$4.99B (2024), growing at 21% CAGR → projected $15.71B by 2030** (GlobeNewswire)
- Estimated call center spend: **$150-300M/year** (growing fast)

**Call Center Usage**
- Claims submission intake
- Claims status (high frequency — pet owners are anxious)
- Coverage questions (complex benefit structures)
- New policy onboarding
- Renewals / cancellations

**Outsourcing Propensity: High**
Pet insurance companies are predominantly insurtechs and MGAs (Lemonade, Spot, Odie, ManyPets, Fetch, Figo) with small internal teams. They simply don't have call center infrastructure and rely on outsourcing or basic customer service platforms.

**Market Fragmentation: Very High**
15+ meaningful players in the US alone, with new entrants constantly. Key players: Trupanion, Healthy Paws, Embrace, Nationwide Pet, ASPCA/Pets Best, Lemonade Pet, Spot, Odie, ManyPets, Figo, Pumpkin, MetLife Pet, Fetch.

**AI Automation Potential: Very High**
Pet insurance calls are extremely structured. FNOL ("my dog needs surgery") follows a simple intake script. Claims status is a database lookup. Policy questions are FAQ-style. Voice AI can handle 70-80%+ of calls with high customer satisfaction — pet owners just want quick answers.

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**
Fast-growing, fragmented, no legacy infrastructure, founder-led companies open to new vendors, high call volume relative to team size, simple call scripts. **This is Glima's beachhead.**

---

### 2.4 Renters Insurance

**Market Size**
- US market: **~$3.5B in premiums (2024), growing at 10.3% CAGR**
- Estimated call center spend: **$50-100M/year**

**Call Center Usage**
- Simple FNOL (theft, water damage)
- Coverage questions
- Billing
- Renewals (often automatic, low call volume)

**Outsourcing Propensity: Medium-High**
Renters insurance is often a low-margin, high-volume product sold by insurtechs (Lemonade, Toggle, Jetty) who rely heavily on digital self-service. Call center volume is lower, but growing as the market expands.

**Market Fragmentation: Medium**
Dominated by the same large carriers (State Farm, Allstate, Lemonade) but with a growing insurtech layer.

**AI Automation Potential: High**
Renters insurance claims are simple and repetitive — great AI use case, but lower urgency given smaller market.

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐**
Attractive but smaller than other segments. Better as an upsell to pet or auto customers than a standalone beachhead.

---

### 2.5 Small Commercial / Business Insurance

**Market Size**
- US small commercial (1-50 employees): **~$100-150B in premiums**
- Estimated call center spend: **$500M-1B/year**

**Call Center Usage**
- New policy inquiries / quoting support
- Claims intake
- Certificate of insurance requests (very high volume)
- Billing and audits

**Outsourcing Propensity: High**
Small commercial is notoriously complex to service. Carriers use BPOs and MGAs extensively. Focus Insurance BPO specifically cites helping a new carrier go "from 0 to 35,000 policies" in small commercial with full BPO support.

**Market Fragmentation: High**
Hundreds of MGAs, program administrators, and specialty carriers — none have the scale for big in-house operations. Coterie, Next Insurance, Thimble, Hiscox, Pie Insurance are tech-forward targets.

**AI Automation Potential: Medium**
Certificate of insurance issuance (COI) is extremely high-volume and automatable. Claims intake and billing work well. But underwriting questions and complex coverage consultations still need humans.

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐**
Large, fragmented, outsourcing-friendly. Certificate-of-insurance automation alone could be a killer use case.

---

### 2.6 Specialty Lines (Vehicle Warranty, Travel, Roadside)

**Market Size**
- Vehicle warranty: **$32.7B US market (2025, IBISWorld)**, CAGR ~2.7%
- Travel insurance: ~$5B US
- Roadside assistance: ~$2B US
- Estimated combined call center spend: **$500M-1.5B/year**

**Call Center Usage**
- Vehicle warranty: Claims authorization, service dispatch, contractor coordination
- Travel: FNOL (trip cancellation, medical emergency abroad), claims intake
- Roadside: Dispatch (breakdown, towing, lockout) — extremely high call volume

**Outsourcing Propensity: Very High**
Vehicle warranty companies are almost entirely built on outsourced operations. Roadside assistance (Agero, Allstate Roadside, Quest Towing) is essentially a pure BPO model. These companies HAVE to outsource — they have no other model.

**Market Fragmentation: Very High**
Hundreds of vehicle warranty companies (CARCHEX, CarShield, Endurance, AmTrust, etc.). Dozens of travel insurers. Multiple roadside networks.

**AI Automation Potential: Very High**
Vehicle warranty and roadside calls follow rigid scripts. "Is this covered? Where can I take it?" is an AI-native workflow. Roadside dispatch ("I'm stranded at mile marker 42 on I-95") is highly structured and can be automated with GPS + AI.

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**
The vehicle warranty space is essentially a BPO with a license attached. Glima could replace the entire call center operation for warranty companies. Massive opportunity.

---

### 2.7 Life Insurance

**Market Size**
- US life insurance premiums: ~$600B+ (whole market)
- Life/pension leads overall BPO market share at 58.9% (IMARC)
- Estimated call center spend: **$2-4B/year**

**Call Center Usage**
- Policy servicing (beneficiary changes, address updates)
- Claims intake (death claims — emotionally sensitive)
- Premium billing / lapse notices
- Surrender / loan inquiries

**Outsourcing Propensity: High (back-office), Medium (call center)**
Large carriers (MetLife, Prudential, New York Life) run captive call centers. Mid-size and smaller life carriers actively outsource.

**AI Automation Potential: Medium**
Billing and policy servicing are automatable. Death claims are emotionally charged and complex — AI should assist, not replace, here. The sensitivity of death claims is a significant barrier to full AI automation.

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐**
Large market but lower AI automation potential for core claims calls due to emotional sensitivity. Better for billing/servicing automation.

---

### 2.8 Health Insurance

**Market Size**
- US health insurance: ~$1.3T in premiums
- Estimated call center spend: **$5-10B/year** (enormous volume)

**Call Center Usage**
- Member eligibility verification
- Prior authorization (massive volume)
- Claims status
- Provider directory inquiries
- Billing / premium payments

**Outsourcing Propensity: High**
Health BPO is a large, established market. Many regional health plans and Medicare Advantage plans outsource member services.

**AI Automation Potential: Medium-High**
Prior auth and eligibility verification are structurally automatable. SuperDial raised $15M in Series A (June 2025) specifically to automate insurance voice calls in healthcare. Strong AI momentum here, but the market is extremely regulated (HIPAA) and dominated by large vendors (Cognizant, Accenture, Conduent).

**Overall Attractiveness: ⭐⭐⭐**
Massive market but high regulatory burden, dominated by large established BPOs, and long sales cycles. Better as a future expansion after establishing a brand in P&C.

## 3. Prioritization Framework

### Scoring Matrix

| Segment | Fragmentation (1-5) | Outsourcing Propensity (1-5) | Call Volume (1-5) | AI Automation Potential (1-5) | Tech Openness (1-5) | **Total (25)** | **Rating** |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| Pet Insurance | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | **24** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Specialty/Warranty | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | **23** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Personal Auto (Regional/MGA) | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | **22** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Homeowners | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **20** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Small Commercial | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **18** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Health Insurance | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | **18** | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Renters Insurance | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 4 | **17** | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Life Insurance | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 2 | **14** | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### Top 3 Segments with Rationale

**🥇 #1: Pet Insurance**
The perfect beachhead. Fast-growing (21% CAGR), extremely fragmented (15+ real players, more launching every year), founder/insurtech-led companies that are culturally open to new vendors, high call volume relative to team size, simple call scripts (claims intake, status, FAQ), and no legacy call center infrastructure to displace. A deal with Spot, Odie, or ManyPets could be signed in weeks, not months. Reference customers here open every door.

**🥈 #2: Vehicle Warranty / Specialty Lines**
CarShield has 1M+ policyholders. Endurance, CARCHEX, and dozens of others run on pure outsourced call center models. For these companies, their call center IS their product — they answer calls from worried car owners. AI that handles claims authorization and service dispatch is directly revenue-generating. Willingness to pay is high because the unit economics are obvious.

**🥉 #3: Personal Auto — Regional Carriers & MGAs**
The largest total addressable market. Regional carriers (Erie, Kemper, The General, GAINSCO, Texas-focused carriers) are under extreme cost pressure as the big 5 gain market share. They already outsource FNOL. An AI product that's 40-60% cheaper than their current BPO contract is a compelling pitch. Sales cycles are longer (3-6 months), but deals are larger.

---

## 4. Types of Operations Outsourced to Call Centers

### 4.1 FNOL — First Notice of Loss

**What it is:** The first call a policyholder makes to report an accident, theft, or loss. For auto: "I just got into an accident." For home: "My basement flooded."

**Why it gets outsourced:** 24/7 coverage requirement, unpredictable surge volume, requires specialized training (empathy + data collection protocol). Most carriers can't staff this cost-effectively in-house.

**AI Automation Potential: High**
AI can gather structured incident data (date, location, parties involved, description) following a fixed intake script. Liberate claims 75% digital FNOL automation. Floatbot claims 80% of FNOL submissions automated.

**Commentary:** For voice AI, FNOL is the sweet spot. The call has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The information needed is structured. Emotional support can be scripted ("I understand this is stressful — let me get your claim started right away"). ElevenLabs-quality voice makes this feel human.

**Voice AI Ready Today: YES** — with proper escalation paths for complex situations.

---

### 4.2 Claims Status Follow-Up

**What it is:** Policyholders calling to check "Where is my claim? When will I get paid?" — typically multiple calls per claim lifecycle.

**Why it gets outsourced:** High volume, low complexity. The caller wants one piece of information. Agents spend most of the call on hold looking up data.

**AI Automation Potential: High**
Pure lookup + communication. AI connects to claims management system, authenticates the policyholder, reads out claim status. No judgment needed.

**Commentary:** This may be the single highest ROI automation Glima can offer. It's the most frequent call type, the most repetitive, and the most amenable to automation. Every carrier that outsources this is paying $15-25/call for information retrieval.

**Voice AI Ready Today: YES** — this should be the MVP feature.

---

### 4.3 Billing & Payments

**What it is:** Premium payment processing, payment plan setup, NSF call resolution, billing disputes.

**Why it gets outsourced:** Routine, rules-based, high volume. No claims expertise needed.

**AI Automation Potential: High**
Taking payments, reading back balance information, setting up autopay — all AI-native. Integration with payment processors (Stripe, etc.) is straightforward.

**Commentary:** Voice AI excels here. "Your premium of $147 is due on March 15. Would you like to pay now with the card on file?" is a 60-second automated call.

**Voice AI Ready Today: YES**

---

### 4.4 Policy Renewals

**What it is:** Proactive outbound calls to remind policyholders about upcoming renewals, quote new rates, retain at-risk accounts.

**Why it gets outsourced:** High volume, seasonal, requires clear communication skills.

**AI Automation Potential: High**
Outbound AI calls for renewal reminders are a well-established use case. Quoting is more complex but can be scripted for simple personal lines.

**Commentary:** The outbound renewal call is an excellent AI use case — scripted, outcome-measurable, and currently expensive at scale. This could be a second product module after inbound claims.

**Voice AI Ready Today: YES (for simple lines)**

---

### 4.5 New Customer Onboarding

**What it is:** Welcome calls after policy purchase, explaining coverage, setting up payment, collecting any remaining information.

**Why it gets outsourced:** High volume in growth phases, consistency is critical.

**AI Automation Potential: Medium-High**
Structured script, but requires some flexibility to answer questions. Works well with AI + escalation.

**Commentary:** Onboarding calls are relationship-building moments. AI can handle the structured parts (welcome, coverage summary, payment setup) and escalate to human for complex questions.

**Voice AI Ready Today: YES (with human escalation)**

---

### 4.6 Customer Service / FAQ

**What it is:** General "Where can I find my policy? What is my deductible? How do I add a driver?" questions.

**Why it gets outsourced:** Highly variable, 24/7 demand, difficult to staff efficiently.

**AI Automation Potential: High**
Most insurance FAQs have known answers. RAG-based AI on the policy document + carrier knowledge base can answer 80%+ of these calls.

**Commentary:** This is where LLM-backed voice AI shines. ElevenLabs' agent architecture supports tool use and knowledge retrieval. A carrier's FAQ + policy terms fed into the context window handles most calls.

**Voice AI Ready Today: YES**

---

### 4.7 Fraud Detection Intake

**What it is:** Red-flag flagging during FNOL or claims calls. Suspicious timing, inconsistent stories, prior claim history flags.

**Why it gets outsourced:** Requires both call handling and analysis. Specialized BPOs have scoring models.

**AI Automation Potential: Medium**
AI can flag linguistic inconsistencies, unusual claim patterns, and metadata anomalies. But final fraud determination requires human adjuster review. AI as a co-pilot for fraud detection is ready; AI as the decision-maker is not.

**Commentary:** Glima can build fraud flagging as a feature (sentiment analysis, inconsistency detection) rather than a standalone product.

**Voice AI Ready Today: PARTIALLY — as a flag/alert system**

---

### 4.8 Roadside Assistance Dispatch

**What it is:** "I'm stuck on the highway, my tire is flat, I need a tow." Intake, GPS location, dispatch to nearest service provider.

**Why it gets outsourced:** 24/7, high volume, very structured — all calls follow the same pattern.

**AI Automation Potential: Very High**
This is perhaps the most automatable call type in insurance. Location collection, service type selection, dispatch confirmation — all fully scriptable. No empathy complexity of a serious accident claim.

**Commentary:** Several tech providers already offer this. Agero (largest roadside network) is moving toward automation. An AI that handles "I need a tow" end-to-end is entirely feasible today.

**Voice AI Ready Today: YES — probably the highest containment rate of any call type**

### 5.3 Glima's Differentiation

The competitive landscape reveals a clear gap:

| | Traditional BPO (ACTEC, Covenir) | AI Platforms (Glia, Liberate) | Glima |
|--|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Delivery | Human agents | Software license | AI-native voice agents |
| Pricing | Per-call / per-minute | Enterprise SaaS | Usage-based / per-minute |
| Setup time | Weeks to months | Months | Days |
| Cost | $15-35/call | $$$$ enterprise | <$5/call |
| Target | Mid-large carriers | Large carriers | Small-mid carriers, MGAs, insurtechs |
| 24/7 | Yes (expensive) | Yes | Yes (native) |
| Scalability | Hire staff | Limited | Infinite |

**Glima's unique position:**
1. **AI-native, not AI-bolted-on** — built from day one for AI voice (vs. BPOs adding AI as a feature)
2. **Priced for the long tail** — designed for carriers with 5,000-100,000 policies, not just the top 25
3. **Fast time to value** — days to deploy vs. months for Glia or Focus BPO
4. **Vertical focus** — deep insurance knowledge baked into every agent (terminology, regulatory nuance, empathy patterns)
5. **True 24/7 surge handling** — no "Call Surge Guarantee" needed; AI scales instantly

## 7. Go-To-Market Recommendation

### Recommended ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

**Company type:** P&C insurer, MGA, or specialty warranty provider  
**Size:** 5,000 – 200,000 policies in force  
**Team:** 5-50 person operations team (no massive internal call center)  
**Current state:** Already outsourcing calls to a BPO, OR handling with a small internal team stretched thin  
**Lines:** Pet insurance, vehicle warranty, non-standard auto, specialty P&C  
**Decision maker:** VP Operations, Head of Customer Experience, COO/CFO  
**Budget trigger:** Current BPO contract renewal, growth without adding headcount, catastrophe response cost shock  

**Why this ICP:**
- Small enough to move fast (no 18-month procurement cycles)
- Large enough for meaningful revenue (~$50-200K ARR per customer)
- Already mentally aware they have a call center problem
- No legacy infrastructure to displace

---

### First Segment to Attack and Why

**Pet Insurance — Launch Here**

- Fastest growing segment (21% CAGR), constant new entrants
- Founders/CEOs are accessible and make fast decisions
- No procurement bureaucracy
- Call types are simple (FNOL intake, claims status, FAQ)
- 15+ targets, need only 3-5 to prove the model
- Community is tight — one reference customer spreads quickly
- Sales cycle: 2-4 weeks vs. 3-6 months for traditional carriers

---

### How to Reach Them

**Channels:**
1. **Direct outbound LinkedIn** to VP Operations / Head of CX at target companies
2. **Industry events:** PCI (Property Casualty Insurers), NAIC conferences, InsureTech Connect (Las Vegas, Oct), PetCon industry events
3. **Insurance MGA associations:** AAMGA, TMPAA — both have newsletters and member directories
4. **Cold email with case study** — once first customer proof point exists, outbound converts at 5-10%
5. **Partnerships:** HawkSoft, Applied Epic, Majesco, Duck Creek — AMS partners who can refer
6. **YC Demo Day networking** — several insurtech YC companies (Avallon, etc.) are natural first customers and referrers

---

### Pricing Model Recommendation

**Usage-based with base subscription**

| Tier | Monthly calls | Price/minute | Base fee | Best for |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Starter | 0-1,000 calls | $0.25/min | $500/mo | Small insurtechs, pilot |
| Growth | 1,000-10,000 calls | $0.18/min | $1,500/mo | Mid-size MGAs |
| Scale | 10,000+ calls | $0.12/min | $5,000/mo | Regional carriers |

**Why usage-based:**
- Aligns with how BPO competitors price (per-call/per-minute)
- Buyers understand the unit economics immediately
- Scales naturally with customer growth
- Easy ROI calculation: "You're paying $20/call now; we're $2-4/call"

**Expected economics:**
- Average call: 4-6 minutes at $0.18/min = ~$0.90-1.08/call
- Vs. BPO outsourcing: $15-35/call
- **Value proposition: 90%+ cost reduction**

### Key Objections + How to Handle Them

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Our customers need to talk to a human" | "They can — we route complex calls instantly. 80% never need to. Your team focuses on the 20% that matter." |
| "What if AI gets it wrong during a claim?" | "AI captures data; humans review and adjudicate. FNOL intake doesn't make claims decisions. We reduce errors vs. humans who mishear information." |
| "We're worried about compliance / state regulations" | "We're SOC2/HIPAA compliant, all calls recorded and transcribed, full audit trail. More compliant than a remote BPO agent." |
| "We have an existing BPO contract" | "Great — when does it renew? We can run a parallel pilot before your contract ends." |
| "What about complex calls?" | "We handle the 70-80% that are routine. You keep your team for the rest. Net: you reduce costs 60%+ and improve response times." |
